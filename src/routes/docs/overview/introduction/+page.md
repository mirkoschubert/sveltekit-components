## Components for SvelteKit

`sveltekit-components` is an opinionated UI kit exclusively for SvelteKit. Please not that the library is in **early alpha** and under heavy development! Some components may break in the future, so please don't use it in production.

## Motivation

There are not many UI libraries or single components for SvelteKit. Some libraries provide only a few components and are not suitable for creating a complete website or webapp.

In the course of rebuilding my own website mirkoschubert.com I decided to create one of the most comprehensive SvelteKit component libraries. Besides, I want to learn more about Svelte and SvelteKit during the development of the components in order to implement future webapps faster.

## Contribution

If you want to contribute please report any [issues](https://github.com/mirkoschubert/sveltekit-components/issues) you find while using my library! You can also develop new or planned components by forking the [Github repository](https://github.com/mirkoschubert/sveltekit-components/) and create a pull request once you finished.
